# RadioduinoWRT

## Info 

RadioduinoWRT is a hard- and software project by Raffael Herrmann, which aims to create a physical webradio. It's based on TP-Link's WR703N router, an Arduino Mega Rev.3 and some other hardware parts.

It's more a proof of concept, than the perfect solution, but it finally works.

Feel free to grab-up/fork the project and make it better!
